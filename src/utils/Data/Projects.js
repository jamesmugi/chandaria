          Kenyatta University is implementing the Technology Transfer and Commercialization of University Intellectual Property (TT-CUIP) project. The project contributes to improving technology transfer and the commercialization of intellectual property at Kenyatta University (KU) as well as University of Rwanda (UR). Through capacity building, the TT-CUIP project supports the two partner universities in developing strong links with industry and encouraging their staff to commercialise their innovations and research results. The goal is to build strong links with industry and help university staff bring their innovations and research results to market by creating start-ups. An entrepreneurial mindset and in-depth knowledge of the legal and institutional framework are taught.

        In July 2022, a delegation of transfer managers from KU and UR travelled to Neu-Ulm to benchmark different approaches and business models of university-industry linkages and startup support. The delegates visited various institutions in southern Germany. The comparison enables them to transfer promising approaches to their own context.
      </p>
      <p>
        In September, project leader Prof. Dr. Thomas Bayer conducted a technology transfer workshop for senior management and a lecturer training in application-oriented teaching and research in Kenya and Rwanda. First, university managers from UR and KU convened in Kigali for an interactive workshop about technology transfer and commercialization of university intellectual property. The three universities exchanged best practices and experiences in the area of technology transfer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the delegates visited relevant labs, the incubation center and successfully incubated start-ups.

ACWICT is a Kenya-based organisation, with a regional reach whose mission is to promote women and youth access to and knowledge of ICTs as tools for sustainable development. The organisation reaches over 25,000 women and youth annually and has trained over 178,000 youth in various ICT skills to date with 70% placed into internships, jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities.  ACWICT played a role in developing the national training curriculum and mentorship strategy for the Ajira Digital Program of the Government of Kenya, in which KU participated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DS4E training will be offered to interested KU students at no cost and will include skills in coding and programming, digital workspace and freelancing, digital literacy and entrepreneurship, cybersecurity essentials and STEM initiative workshops where local and global professionals will speak on job market projections and skills for future job market needs. The training emphasises participation of female students to promote gender equity and empower women through the technology and digital sectors, which are traditionally male-dominated fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          ACWICT is collaborating with Microsoft to provide the training, they have been granted proprietary licences by Microsoft for learners to access a variety of free education resources and for developing digital innovations and products.

        Kenyatta University signed a memorandum of understanding with Arc Ride Kenya Limited in electric vehicle technology. This partnership will provide a platform for teaching, supervision, staff and student exchange, scholarships, international seminars and conferences, exchange of materials, support and/or facilities for students and staff as a formal element of a degree or programme especially the School of Engineering and Technology."
      </p>
      <p>
        Arc Ride Kenya Limited specializes in the mass adoption of electric two and three wheelers in rapidly growing African cities. The company designs, builds and grows the leading battery-as-a-service business across Africa. To provide affordable, reliable and clean e-mobility solutions for rapidly developing African cities, the company has in place swapping cabinets which allow affordable, reliable and clean access to ride all day. The cabinets allow a rider to swap a battery with a fully charged one at a fee. This saves time and money since a rider does not have to wait for a battery to be charged.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and the need for cleaner energy alternatives, the rise of electric mobility or e-Mobility, has emerged as a promising solution. With advancements in technology and growing environmental consciousness, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained momentum, offering a sustainable and efficient mode of transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        While e-Mobility holds immense potential, several challenges need to be addressed for widespread adoption. These include the expansion of charging infrastructure, addressing range anxiety, enhancing battery technology, and ensuring access to clean energy sources. Governments, businesses, and stakeholders must collaborate to overcome these challenges and create an enabling environment for e-Mobility to flourish. 
      </p>
      <p>
        e-Mobility represents a transformative shift towards a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future of transportation. With its potential to reduce carbon emissions, enhance energy efficiency, and drive technological innovation, e-Mobility offers a pathway to combat climate change and improve air quality. By embracing electric vehicles and supporting the development of robust charging infrastructure, Arc Ride Kenya Limited and Kenyatta University can collectively drive towards a future where mobility is efficient, eco-friendly and in harmony with the planet.
